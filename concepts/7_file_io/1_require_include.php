/*
1Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling: include "/partials/_dbconnect.php" | require "/partials/_dbconnect.php"
-> include generates a warning (E_WARNING) if the file is missing but continues execution.
-> require generates a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) if the file is missing and stops execution immediately.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Use Case:
-> include is used for optional files, such as sidebars, ads, or analytics scripts.
-> require is used for critical files, such as database connections or configuration files.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Impact:
-> Both work similarly, but using include may cause unexpected issues if a required file fails to load.
-> require ensures that the script doesn't run with missing dependencies, preventing potential errors later.

Rule of Thumb üëç: Use require for essential files & include for optional ones!
